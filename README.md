A first-person survival game based off of my friend Brad.


# Background
I met my friend Brad while playing Rocket League in 2016. Brad lives in Columbus, Ohio while I live in San Diego. Ever since meeting him we've become very good friends even with our physical distance.

In 2022 Brad flew down to San Diego and I got to see him in-person for the first time. I was very happy to show him around my hometown.

In 2023 I got the chance to go to Columbus to see him and his family. I had an amazing experience spending time in the city. 

I decided to make this game because I wanted to give him a fun birthday surprise. I started development in July and put in many hours into developing this game inspired by my friend. It's safe to say that he's very happy with the end result.


# Gameplay
This game takes place in Columbus, Ohio and involves the main playing trying to survive and gain money. The player can use the in-game Item Shop in order to buy and sell goods. The end-goal is to gain $10,000 in order to travel to California. The player will need to experiment with different methods of gaining money in order to reach this goal. Some examples include:
- Betting on fictitious sports games
- Farming corn
- Mowing the lawn
- Cutting down trees


# How to Play
First download the installer for the latest version, then follow the instructions in the install wizard. Once the game has been installed it should automatically open. Press "Play" to begin a new session.

## Controls
- **W**: Move forward
- **A**: Move left
- **S**: Move back
- **D**: Move right
- **Space**: Jump

# Development
For this project, I used Unity because of its ease of use and that fact that it integrates nicely with C#. To view all of the C# scripts, go to Assets -> Scripts.

The first part of this game I developed was the movement controls. Then I reached an obstacle when trying to create the world generation. My problem was that I wanted the grass and trees to respawn freshly after being cut. Issues like this helped me become proficient in C# and were a fun challenge.

I wanted the game to work seamlessly on any computer and not put any burden on the user so I created an installer for Windows and macOS. I also rigorously playtested the game to make sure there weren't any major bugs in the game.

The entire process taught me about the software development cycle as previously I had never worked on a project this large. I'm very glad I was successfully in releasing my game and I'm hoping to share it with more people.
